I will illustrate how to enable Latex support in Markdown for your Jekyll blog without the use of external Jekyll plugins. This will allow you to benefit from beautiful typesetting even when using Github Pages, especially if you’re mathematically inclined like me and wish to better disperse your writings in a clearer fashion. I only assume you’re familiar with Jekyll and are proficient working with it, in order to save time reading about the nitty gritties of Jekyll.

```
Here, have some $$\pi$$.

The greatest equation known to man is: 

$$e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}$$
```

Here, have some $$\pi$$.

The greatest equation known to man is: 

$$e^{ix} = \cos{x} + i\sin{x}$$

That is it!
